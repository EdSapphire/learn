***This is an ALX SE printf team project, done by Edward Ebenezer and Peace Aigbokhaebholo.***

*Title Of Project* - <h3> printf </h3>

<h4> Project Tasks </h4>
0. Write a function that produces output according to a format, the functions returns 
number of characters printed.
1. Write a function that handles conversion specifers.
2. Write a function that handles custom conversion specifiers, where the unsigned int
argument is converted to binary
3. Write a function that handles following conversion specifiers "u, o, x, X"
4. Write a function that uses a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call 'write' as little as possible.
5. Write a function that handles the following custom conversion specifier:
- s: prints the spring
- Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
6. Write a function that handles a conversion specifer: p.
7. Write a function that handles the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: +, space, #.
8. Write a function that handles the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: l, h
Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X.
9. Write a function that handles the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
10. Write a function that handles the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
11. Write a function that handles the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
12. Write a function that handles the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
13. Write a function that handles the following custom conversion specifier: 
r : prints the reversed string
14. Write a function that handles the following custom conversion specifier:
R: prints the rot13'ed string
15. All the above functions must work well together.
